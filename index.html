      <h2>About our quiz</h2>
      <p>If you're like most people and have given a passing thought to the idea of coding, you might've come to the conclusion that there are quite a few languages in use today and a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> of pros and cons of each that people on the internet will be entirely too happy to share with you.</p>
      <p>We get it and here at BizzFEED we hoped making this page would give you some ideas of what's best for you.</p>
      <p>Below there is a series of questions designed by our incredibly qualified and totally legit science team to help you make those choices.  Don't think about it too much, just answer what feels right</p>
